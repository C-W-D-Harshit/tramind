# TRAMIND Drills Guide

## 🎮 Available Drills

### 1. ⚡ Reflex (Click) - `/drill/reflex`
**Type**: Click-based
**Goal**: Click visual targets as fast as possible

**How it works**:
- Random colored circles appear on screen
- Click them as fast as you can
- Tracks: reaction time, consistency, false starts
- 10-20 rounds based on difficulty

**Scoring**:
- Base score: 1000 - average reaction time (ms)
- Consistency bonus: up to +30%
- False start penalty: -50 points each

**Tips**:
- Keep your hand steady near the mouse
- Focus on the center of the screen
- Don't click before the target appears!

### 2. ⌨️ Keyboard Reflex - `/drill/keyboard-reflex`
**Type**: Keyboard-based
**Goal**: Press the correct key as fast as possible

**How it works**:
- A key appears on screen (SPACE, ENTER, A, S, D, F, J, K, L)
- Press that specific key as fast as you can
- Wrong key = failed round
- Tracks: reaction time per key

**Scoring**:
- Same as Reflex drill
- Wrong key press = 0 points for that round

**Tips**:
- Keep both hands on keyboard (ASDF for left, JKL; for right)
- Look at the screen, not your keyboard
- Practice the home row position
- Spacebar and Enter are easy - others require precision

**Advanced**:
- Higher difficulty = more varied keys
- Speed improvements come from muscle memory

---

### 3. 👁 Awareness Drill - `/drill/awareness`
**Status**: Not yet implemented
**Goal**: Track moving targets, avoid distractors

**Planned features**:
- Objects move across screen
- Click only blue circles (target)
- Ignore red/yellow shapes (distractors)
- 60-second sessions
- Tracks hit rate and accuracy

---

### 4. 🎯 Impulse Control - `/drill/impulse`
**Status**: Not yet implemented
**Goal**: Resist clicking during urge waves

**Planned features**:
- Visual "urge bar" rises
- Messages tempt you to click
- Resist for 15+ seconds = success
- 5-10 rounds per session

---

### 5. 🧠 Focus Drill - `/drill/focus`
**Status**: Not yet implemented
**Goal**: Maintain focus on moving target

**Planned features**:
- Follow moving target with cursor
- Distractions try to break focus
- Track continuous focus time
- 60-180 second sessions

---

## 📊 Progression System

### Difficulty Levels
- **Level 1-3**: Beginner (larger targets, slower)
- **Level 4-6**: Intermediate (smaller targets, faster)
- **Level 7-9**: Advanced (complex patterns)
- **Level 10+**: Expert (maximum challenge)

### Leveling Up
- Complete 5 sessions
- Must show improvement
- Average score must exceed previous average

### XP & Stars
**Star Rating**:
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars): 95%+ perfect score
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4 stars): 85-94%
- ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3 stars): 70-84%
- ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (2 stars): 50-69%
- ⭐☆☆☆☆ (1 star): Below 50%

**XP Calculation**:
```
Base XP = score / 10
Star Bonus = stars × 20
Difficulty Multiplier = 1 + (difficulty × 0.1)
Streak Bonus = min(500, streak × 50)

Total XP = (Base XP + Star Bonus) × Difficulty × Streak Bonus
```

## 🎯 Comparison: Click vs Keyboard Reflex

### When to use Click Reflex:
- ✅ Train mouse accuracy
- ✅ Improve hand-eye coordination
- ✅ Better for gaming (FPS, MOBA)
- ✅ Works on any device

### When to use Keyboard Reflex:
- ✅ Train finger speed
- ✅ Improve typing reflexes
- ✅ Better for keyboard-heavy tasks
- ✅ Builds muscle memory for keys
- ✅ More consistent (no mouse movement)

### Which is harder?
**Keyboard Reflex** is typically harder because:
- Must identify specific key
- Requires accuracy (wrong key = fail)
- Less visual feedback
- More cognitive load

**But** with practice, keyboard can be faster due to:
- No cursor movement needed
- Muscle memory kicks in
- Less hand movement overall

## 💡 Training Tips

### General
1. **Warm up**: Do 1-2 practice rounds
2. **Consistency > Speed**: Better to be consistently good than occasionally great
3. **Track progress**: Check your Progress page regularly
4. **Daily practice**: 3 sessions per drill recommended
5. **Mix it up**: Alternate between drills to avoid burnout

### Specific to Click Reflex
- Position mouse in center of screen
- Use comfortable mouse sensitivity
- Keep wrist stable, move from elbow
- Look for the flash, not the exact position first

### Specific to Keyboard Reflex
- Use proper typing posture
- Home row position: ASDF (left), JKL; (right)
- Don't look at keyboard during practice
- Spacebar with thumb, Enter with pinky
- Practice the least familiar keys separately

### Breaking Plateaus
- Take a day off if frustrated
- Try different time of day
- Adjust screen brightness
- Check your posture
- Increase difficulty temporarily, then go back

## 🎓 Science Behind the Drills

### Click Reflex
**Trains**: Visual processing, motor cortex, reaction time
**Neural pathway**: Eyes → Visual cortex → Motor cortex → Hand muscles
**Improvement**: Myelination of neural pathways (faster signal transmission)

### Keyboard Reflex
**Trains**: Visual processing, working memory, motor patterns
**Neural pathway**: Eyes → Visual cortex → Working memory (key identification) → Motor cortex → Finger muscles
**Improvement**: Both faster processing AND motor pattern memory

### Real-world Applications
- **Gaming**: FPS reaction shots, MOBA ability usage
- **Driving**: Brake reaction time
- **Sports**: Ball tracking, quick responses
- **Typing**: Faster keyboard work
- **Daily life**: Catching falling objects, quick decisions

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why two reflex drills?**
A: Different input methods train different neural pathways and muscle groups.

**Q: Which drill should I do first?**
A: Start with Click Reflex - it's more intuitive. Add Keyboard Reflex once comfortable.

**Q: How often should I train?**
A: 2-3 sessions per drill per day is optimal. More can cause fatigue.

**Q: Why are my scores worse some days?**
A: Sleep, caffeine, stress, and time of day all affect reaction time.

**Q: Can I improve at any age?**
A: Yes! Neural plasticity allows improvement throughout life, though younger people may improve faster.

**Q: What's a realistic improvement timeline?**
A: Most people see 20-30% improvement in 2-4 weeks of daily practice.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Try both drills** - See which you prefer
2. **Set a baseline** - Do 3 sessions to establish your average
3. **Daily practice** - Consistency beats intensity
4. **Track progress** - Check your stats weekly
5. **Stay motivated** - Compete with yourself, not others

Remember: **Improvement is not linear**. Some days will be worse than others. The trend over weeks is what matters!
